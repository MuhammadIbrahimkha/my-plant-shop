# React Plant Shop 🌱

This is a personal project built to strengthen my skills in React and frontend development. The application simulates an interactive eCommerce platform where users can explore and add houseplants to their cart, making it a fun and educational way to apply React concepts like components, props, state, and hooks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Plant Cards**: Each plant displays an image, name, price, and a "Buy" button to simulate cart behavior.
- **Purchase Simulation**: The app uses alerts to indicate when a plant is added to the cart.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized to work smoothly on desktops and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: For building interactive UI components and managing state.
- **Vite**: Used as the build tool for faster development and hot module replacement.
- **CSS**: Light styling for layout and visuals; future design improvements planned.

## 📈 Planned Enhancements

- **Expanded Plant Library**: More plant data will be dynamically loaded using a structured JSON format.
- **Filtering System**: Coming soon — sort plants by care level, size, light needs, and more.
- **Refined UI Design**: A polished layout is in progress to enhance the overall user experience.
